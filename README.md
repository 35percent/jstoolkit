# JS Toolkit
## Open source viability testing toolkit

JS Toolkit is a viability testing toolkit developed by xxx and xxx in collaboration with xxx and xxx. 

The toolkit is a resource for community groups to interrogate the viability of development sites and viable level of planning gain for a given site.

It is used by entering the basic parameters of a given development, i.e. the total amount of residential, commercial and retail space proposed.

This is then multiplied by current RIBA average construction costs and CIL tariffs to provide a total scheme cost, which is deducted from total estimated scheme revenue to provide the estimated scheme profit.
